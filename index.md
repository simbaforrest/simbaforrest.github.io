**In August 2018, I will join New York University (NYU) as an assistant professor jointly in the [Department of Civil and Urban Engineering](https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/departments/civil-and-urban-engineering) and the [Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering](https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/departments/mechanical-and-aerospace-engineering), and keep working on robotic vision and robotics for construction and civil engineering!**

I'm currently [a research scientist](http://www.merl.com/people/cfeng) at [Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories (MERL)](http://www.merl.com/).

I obtained my:

* **PhD** degree in the [Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering](http://www.cee.umich.edu) of the [University of Michigan](http://www.umich.edu/), advised by [Professor Vineet R. Kamat](http://pathfinder.engin.umich.edu/);
* two **MSE** degrees in [*EE-Systems*](http://www.eecs.umich.edu/eecs/graduate/ees/EESystemsgraduate.html) and [*Construction Engineering*](http://tcmp.engin.umich.edu/) respectively, both from University of Michigan;
* **BEng** degree in [*Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing*](http://hts.sgg.whu.edu.cn/) from [Wuhan University](http://www.whu.edu.cn/) in China.

My research interests include Computer Vision, Photogrammetry, Robotics, Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, and their applications in civil engineering.
